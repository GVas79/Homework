    <article>


        <p>Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless
            chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and
            the fluids of all known living organisms. It is vital for all known forms of life,
            even though it provides neither food, energy, nor organic micronutrients. Its
            chemical formula, H<sup>2</sup>O,
            indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen
            and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at
            an angle of 104.45&#0176;. "Water" is the name of
            the liquid state of H<sup>2</sup>O at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. A
            number of natural states of water exist. It
            forms precipitation in the form of rain
            and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water
            and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in
            the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor. Water
            covers about 70.9% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans. Small
            portions of water occur as
            groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps
            of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting
            of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%). Water
            moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration
            (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.</p>
