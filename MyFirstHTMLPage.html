                        Wolverines live primarily in isolated arctic, boreal, and alpine regions of northern Canada,
                        Alaska,
                        Siberia,
                        and Fennoscandia; they are also native to European Russia, the Baltic countries, the Russian Far
                        East, northeast
                        China and Mongolia.

                        There had been sporadic records of wolverines in Ukraine, but it is rather unclear whether the
                        wolverines would
                        have formed sustainable populations.

                        Unique records of encounters with wolverines have been noted in Latvia, the most recent one
                        being in
                        late July 2022
                        (although it can be disputed because of the unclear footage); the population was widespread in
                        the
                        16th and 17th centuries,
                        but nowadays it is not native to the area.

                        Wolverines are considered to be primarily scavengers. A majority of the wolverine's sustenance
                        is
                        derived from carrion,
                        on which it depends almost exclusively in winter and early spring. Wolverines may find carrion
                        themselves, feed on it after
                        the predator (often, a pack of wolves) has finished, or simply take it from another predator.
                        Wolverines
                        are also known to follow
                        wolf and lynx trails, purportedly with the intent of scavenging the remains of their kills.
                        Whether
                        eating live prey or carrion,
                        the wolverine's feeding style appears voracious, leading to the nickname of "glutton" (also the
                        basis of
                        the scientific name).
                        However, this feeding style is believed to be an adaptation to food scarcity, especially in
                        winter.

                        The wolverine is also a powerful and versatile predator. Its prey mainly consists of small to
                        medium-sized mammals, but the wolverine
                        has been recorded killing prey such as adult deer that are many times larger than itself. Prey
                        species
                        include porcupines, squirrels,
                        chipmunks, beavers, marmots, moles, gophers, rabbits, voles, mice, rats, shrews, lemmings,
                        caribou,
                        roe
                        deer, white-tailed deer, mule deer,
                        sheep, goats, cattle, bison, moose, and elk. Smaller predators are occasionally preyed on,
                        including
                        martens, mink, foxes, Eurasian lynx,
                        weasels, coyote, and wolf pups. Wolverines have also been known to kill Canada lynx in Yukon,
                        Canada.Wolverines often pursue live prey
                        that are relatively easy to obtain, including animals caught in traps, newborn mammals, and deer
                        (including adult moose and elk) when they
                        are weakened by winter or immobilized by heavy snow. Their diets are sometimes supplemented by
                        birds'
                        eggs, birds (especially geese), roots,
                        seeds, insect larvae, and berries.

                        Wolves, American black bears, brown bears, cougars, and golden eagles are capable of killing
                        wolverines, particularly young and inexperienced individuals.Wolves are thought to be the
                        wolverine's most important natural predator, with the arrival of wolves to a wolverine's
                        territory presumably leading the latter to abandon the area.Armed with powerful jaws, sharp
                        claws, and a thick hide,wolverines, like most mustelids, are remarkably strong for their
                        size. They may defend against larger or more numerous predators such as wolves or bears.[36] By
                        far, their most serious predator is the grey wolf, with an extensive record of wolverine
                        fatalities attributed to wolves in both North America and Eurasia.In North
                        America, another predator (less frequent) is the cougar.At least one account reported a
                        wolverine's apparent attempt to steal a kill from a black bear, although the bear won what was
                        ultimately a fatal contest for the wolverine.There are a few accounts of brown bears
                        killing and consuming wolverines as well and, although also reported at times to be chased off
                        prey, in some areas such as Denali National Park, wolverines seemed to try to actively avoid
                        encounters with grizzly bears as they have been reported in areas where wolves start hunting
                        them.
